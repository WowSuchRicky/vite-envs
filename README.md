# Motivation

In a Vite environment, variables (`import.meta.env.VITE_FOO`) are embedded into your static website at build time when you execute `vite build`.  
What if you want to allow the individual deploying your web app to configure the environment variables?  
`vite-envs` facilitates this by enabling you to:

```bash
docker run --env FOO="xyz" my-org/my-vite-app
```

Then, access `FOO`:

-   In your code, as `import.meta.env.FOO`
-   In `index.html`, like `<title>%FOO%</title>` or `<title><%= import.meta.env.FOO %></title>` (EJS)

This method eliminates the need to rebuild your web app each time you wish to change some configuration.  
More importantly, it allows you to distribute a customizable Docker image of your web app!

# Features

-   âœ… Easy to setup, does not require you to rethink your build system, does not break your Storybook.
-   âœ… Secure: Only injects the envs declared in the `.env` file
-   âœ… Brings type safety to your environment variables (`import.meta.env` gets type definition).
-   âœ… Requires no network connection at container startup.
-   âœ… No impact on container startup time.
-   âœ… SEO: Enable to dynamically generate `<head />` tags by rendering your `index.html` as an EJS template.

# Drawbacks

Using `vite-envs` requires adding [a few extra lines to your Dockerfile](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-demo-app/blob/400360c36acbb1fb703ab0ed185a6272482805e9/Dockerfile#L16-L17) and [including Node.js in your Nginx-based Docker image](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-demo-app/blob/400360c36acbb1fb703ab0ed185a6272482805e9/Dockerfile#L12), which adds an additional 58MB to your Docker image.  
The trade of of including node is justified by the fact that we need some way to re-render the index.html at
container startup. It's verry important for SEO that some tag be present in the `<head />` from the getgo
for social media preview or analitic tool.  
We want to be able to execute some logic in the head based on the dynamic configuration of the web app, EJS
is perfect for the job, we want to be able to write things like this:

```bash
docker run \
  --env TITLE='My org dasboard' \
  --env CUSTOM_META_TAGS='{ description: "Org dasboard for X and Y" }' \
  my-org/my-vite-app
```

`index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <!-- ... -->

        <title>%TITLE%</title>

        <!-- JSON5 is made available by vite-envs, it's a more permissive JSON 
         format that is well fitted for configuration wrote by humans -->
        <% const obj = JSON5.parse(import.meta.env.CUSTOM_META_TAGS); %> <% for (const [key, value] of
        Object.entries(obj)) { %>
        <meta name="<%= key %>" content="<%= value %>" />
        <% } %>
    </head>
</html>
```

The fact that `vite-envs` renders your HTML index as an EJS template also mean
that it might not play well with other plugins that apply transformation to the `index.html`.  
If this is the case, please feel free to open an issue about it.

# Alternative

There is another notable library that addresses the same problem: [import.meta.env](https://import-meta-env.org/).

## Arguments in favor of `vite-envs`

-   **Simpler to Set Up and Transparent:** The scope of [import.meta.env](https://import-meta-env.org/) is much broader, aiming to solve the problem of injecting environment variables into Single Page Applications (SPAs) in general. On the other hand, `vite-envs` focuses on a much narrower use case. It's specifically a Vite plugin designed for seamless integration with your Vite application. The setup process is straightforward and does not impact your Continuous Integration (CI) or build system.

-   **Use Environment Variables in Your `index.html`:** `vite-envs` also supports performing substitutions and running Embedded JavaScript (EJS) in your `index.html` file, which is a must have SEO and preloading fonts for example.

## Arguments in favor of `import.meta.env`

-   **Minimal Impact on Bundle Size:** Unlike `vite-envs`, [which requires Node.js to be available on the host serving your static files](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-demo-app/blob/a4933fc6c190bf3c7033162cee5bcc2c2411ce09/Dockerfile#L12), `import.meta.env` does not affect the bundle size of your Docker image.
    It generates a shell script at build time, which you can execute before serving the application, offering a lightweight solution without additional runtime dependencies.

[Onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia) is a Vite app distributed as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/onyxia-web/tags).

Sysadmins that would like to deploy Onyxia on their infrastructure can simply use
[the official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/onyxia-web/tags) and provide relevant environnement variable to adjust the theme/branding of the website to their usecase as
documented [here](https://docs.onyxia.sh/admin-doc/theme).

Here are two deployment example:
