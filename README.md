# Motivation

In Vite, `import.meta.env` variables are set at build time with `vite build`.  
How can we let deployers configure these variables post-build for flexible deployments?  
`vite-envs` facilitates this by enabling to:

```bash
docker run --env FOO="xyz" my-org/my-vite-app
```

Then, access `FOO`:

-   In the TypeScript code as `import.meta.env.FOO`
-   In `index.html`, as `<title>%FOO%</title>` or `<title><%= import.meta.env.FOO %></title>` (EJS)

This eliminates the need to rebuild each time you wish to change some configuration.  
More importantly, it allows you to ship a customizable Docker image of your webapp!

# Features

-   üîß Effortless setup: Integrates smoothly without requiring modifications to your build system or disrupting your Storybook.
-   üîí Secure: Only injects environment variables explicitly defined in the .env file.
-   üõ°Ô∏è Type-safe: Automatically provides type definition for `import.meta.env`.
-   üì¶ `import.meta.env` is an object, not a placeholder. You can do `Object.keys(import.meta.env)` for example.
-   üåê SEO-friendly: Supports dynamic generation of `<head />` tags by treating `index.html` as an EJS template.

# Trade-offs

Using `vite-envs` requires adding [a few extra lines to your Dockerfile](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-starter/blob/3a4f8a4dc1877a631060900db27e5388520d64a5/Dockerfile#L15-L16) and [including Node.js in your Nginx-based Docker image](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-starter/blob/3a4f8a4dc1877a631060900db27e5388520d64a5/Dockerfile#L11), which adds an additional 58MB to your Docker image.  
The trade-off of including Node.js is justified by the necessity to re-render the `index.html` at container startup.  
It is very important for SEO that certain tags be present in the `<head />` section from the outset for social media previews or analytics tools.  
We want, for example to be able to do:

```bash
docker run \
  --env TITLE='My Org Dashboard' \
  --env CUSTOM_META_TAGS='{ description: "Org Dashboard for X and Y" }' \
  my-org/my-vite-app
```

`index.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>%TITLE%</title>

        <!-- JSON5 is made available by vite-envs, it's a more permissive JSON 
         format that is well fitted for configuration wrote by humans -->
        <% const obj = JSON5.parse(import.meta.env.CUSTOM_META_TAGS); %> <% for (const [key, value] of
        Object.entries(obj)) { %>
        <meta name="<%= key %>" content="<%= value %>" />
        <% } %>
    </head>
</html>
```

The fact that vite-envs processes your HTML index as an EJS template also means it might not integrate smoothly with other
plugins that modify the index.html.  
If this occurs, please do not hesitate to open an issue about it.

# Alternative

There is another notable library that addresses the same problem: [import-meta-env](https://import-meta-env.org/).

## Arguments in favor of `vite-envs`

-   **Simpler to Set Up and Transparent:** The scope of [import-meta-env](https://import-meta-env.org/) is much broader,
    aiming to solve the problem of injecting environment variables into Single Page Applications (SPAs) in general.
    On the other hand, `vite-envs` focuses on a much narrower use case. It's specifically a Vite plugin designed for seamless
    integration with your Vite application. The setup process is straightforward and usage aligns with what you're already used to.

-   **Use Environment Variables in Your `index.html`:** `vite-envs`, supports performing substitutions and running
    Embedded JavaScript (EJS) in your `index.html` file, which is a must have SEO and preloading fonts for example.  
    [import-meta-env](https://import-meta-env.org/) on the other end only enables to access the variables from the JavaScript context.

## Arguments in favor of `import.meta.env`

-   **Minimal Impact on the Docker Image Size:** Unlike `vite-envs`, [which requires Node.js to be available on the host serving your static files](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-starter/blob/c5a93b5322dc2cfdb00768e1ca79c7740f0a9586/Dockerfile#L11),
    `import.meta.env` does not affect the bundle size of your Docker image.
    It generates a shell script at build time, which you can execute before serving the application, offering a lightweight solution without additional runtime dependencies.

[Onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia) is a Vite app distributed as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/onyxia-web/tags).

Sysadmins that would like to deploy Onyxia on their infrastructure can simply use
[the official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/onyxia-web/tags) and provide relevant environnement variable to adjust the theme/branding of the website to their usecase as
documented [here](https://docs.onyxia.sh/admin-doc/theme).

Here are two deployment example:
