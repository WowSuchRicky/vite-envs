# Motivation

In Vite, `import.meta.env` variables are set at build time with `vite build`.  
However we often want to enable the person deploying the app to define those values, we don't want to re build every time we need
to change a configuration.  
`vite-envs` facilitates this by enabling to:

```bash
docker run --env FOO="xyz" my-org/my-vite-app
```

Then, access `FOO`:

-   In the TypeScript code as `import.meta.env.FOO`
-   In `index.html`, as `<title>%FOO%</title>` or `<title><%= import.meta.env.FOO %></title>` (EJS)

This eliminates the need to rebuild each time you wish to change some configuration.  
More importantly, it allows you to ship a customizable Docker image of your webapp!

# Features

-   üîß Effortless setup: Integrates smoothly, works as your already used to, does not disrupt your Storybook.
-   üîí Secure: Only injects environment variables explicitly defined in the `.env` file.
-   üõ°Ô∏è Type-safe: Automatically provides type definition for `import.meta.env`.
-   üì¶ `import.meta.env` is an object, not a placeholder. `Object.keys(import.meta.env)` works.
-   üåê SEO-friendly: Supports dynamic generation of `<head />` tags by treating `index.html` as an EJS template.

# Trade-offs

Incorporating `vite-envs` into your project necessitates minor modifications to your Dockerfile, 
specifically [adding a few lines](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-starter/blob/3a4f8a4dc1877a631060900db27e5388520d64a5/Dockerfile#L15-L16) 
and [embedding Node.js within your Nginx Docker image](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-starter/blob/3a4f8a4dc1877a631060900db27e5388520d64a5/Dockerfile#L11), 
increasing the image size by 58MB. 
This inclusion is crucial for dynamically rendering the `index.html` during container startup, enhancing SEO by ensuring 
essential meta tags are present in the `<head />` for social media previews and analytics.

For instance, to dynamically set titles and custom meta tags, you can use:

```bash
docker run \
  --env TITLE='My Org Dashboard' \
  --env CUSTOM_META_TAGS='{ description: "Org Dashboard for X and Y" }' \
  my-org/my-vite-app
```

`index.html`
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>%TITLE%</title>

        <!-- 
         JSON5 is made available by vite-envs, it's a more permissive JSON 
         format that is well fitted for configuration wrote by humans.
         You can also use YAML.parse()
         -->
        <% const obj = JSON5.parse(import.meta.env.CUSTOM_META_TAGS); %> 
        <% for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(obj)) { %>
          <meta name="<%= key %>" content="<%= value %>" />
        <% } %>
    </head>
</html>
```

Be aware that `vite-envs` might conflict with other plugins transforming `index.html`.  
If you encounter any issues, please report them, and I will endeavor to provide a solution promptly.  

# Alternative

There is another notable library that addresses the same problem: [import-meta-env](https://import-meta-env.org/).

## Arguments in favor of `vite-envs`

-   **Simpler to Set Up and Transparent:** The scope of [import-meta-env](https://import-meta-env.org/) is much broader,
    aiming to solve the problem of injecting environment variables into Single Page Applications (SPAs) in general.
    On the other hand, `vite-envs` focuses on a much narrower use case. It's specifically a Vite plugin designed for seamless
    integration with your Vite application. The setup process is straightforward and usage aligns with what you're already used to.

-   **Use Environment Variables in Your `index.html`:** `vite-envs`, supports performing substitutions and running
    Embedded JavaScript (EJS) in your `index.html` file, which is a must have SEO and preloading fonts for example.  
    [import-meta-env](https://import-meta-env.org/) on the other end only enables to access the variables from the JavaScript context.

## Arguments in favor of `import.meta.env`

-   **Minimal Impact on the Docker Image Size:** Unlike `vite-envs`, [which requires Node.js to be available on the host serving your static files](https://github.com/garronej/vite-envs-starter/blob/c5a93b5322dc2cfdb00768e1ca79c7740f0a9586/Dockerfile#L11),
    `import.meta.env` does not affect the bundle size of your Docker image.
    It generates a shell script at build time, which you can execute before serving the application, offering a lightweight solution without additional runtime dependencies.

[Onyxia](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/onyxia) is a Vite app distributed as a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/onyxia-web/tags).

Sysadmins that would like to deploy Onyxia on their infrastructure can simply use
[the official Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/inseefrlab/onyxia-web/tags) and provide relevant environnement variable to adjust the theme/branding of the website to their usecase as
documented [here](https://docs.onyxia.sh/admin-doc/theme).

Here are two deployment example:
